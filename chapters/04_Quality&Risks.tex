\section{Quality and Risks}
\subsection{Quality Control}
To ensure the final product meets requirements, the following measures will be taken:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Regular testing of software and hardware components.
    \item Peer review of code and design documentation.
    \item Simulation and prototyping before final PCB assembly.
    \item Adherence to best practices in circuit design and software development.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Risk Management}
Potential risks and mitigation strategies include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Component delays}: Order components early to avoid shortages.
    \item \textbf{Hardware failures}: Perform incremental testing to identify issues early.
    \item \textbf{Software bugs}: Use debugging tools and structured coding practices.
    \item \textbf{Time constraints}: Follow the planned schedule and adjust tasks as needed.
\end{itemize}
